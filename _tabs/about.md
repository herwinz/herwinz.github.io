### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ My name is Herwindra Berlian and I am a **DevOps Engineer** currently working at **Privy**. I focus on enabling seamless CI/CD pipelines, enhancing system reliability, and implementing DevOps best practices to support scalable and secure infrastructure.  

âš¡ I am passionate about continuous learning and sharing knowledge. For those interested in AWS, Iâ€™ve compiled learning materials and practical examples in my [AWS Materi](https://github.com/herwinz/aws-materi) repository.  

âš¡ As part of my contributions to **Privy**, I actively support open-source initiatives like the [Privy Infra Atlas project](https://github.com/privy-infra/atlas), where we focus on improving infrastructure as code and streamlining operational workflows.  

âš¡ Currently, Iâ€™m conducting research for my Masterâ€™s thesis at **UGM**, exploring innovative methods for cloud resource optimization and monitoring. This includes developing tools like the [Prometheus Custom Azure Exporter](https://github.com/herwinz/prometheus-custom_azure_exporter) to enhance observability in Azure environments and predictive models for **Cloud Sizing Automation** using time-series forecasting with [Prophet](https://github.com/herwinz/cloudsizing-prophet).  

âš¡ I blog about my DevOps experiences at [herwinz.github.io](https://herwinz.github.io).

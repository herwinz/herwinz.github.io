## Overview

I recently had the opportunity to hop on the [Visual Studio Toolbox Live channel](https://www.youtube.com/@visualstudio/streams) for a 2-part DevOps series: one session on [GitHub Actions](/posts/visual-studio-toolbox-github-actions/) and one session on Azure Pipelines. In this video, we introduce Azure Pipelines, discuss the various pipeline options (classic vs. YAML), compare Azure Pipelines to GitHub Actions, and create a pipeline to build and deploy a sample web app to Azure. I had a great time with Leslie and Robert, and I hope you enjoy the videos!

## Overview

Public previews for [Sub-Issues](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/139932) and [Issue Types](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/139933) have recently shipped, and they are *awesome*! ðŸŽ‰ I encourage you to sign your org up for the opt-in public preview [here](https://github.com/features/issues/signup).

I was looking to do some automation with sub-issues and issue types, and noticed that right now we have to use the GraphQL API to work with them. To run certain queries and mutations, we need the GraphQL IDs of the fields, which if you don't know GraphQL, can be a bit of a challenge. I created these helper scripts to abstract this process and make automation much easier. ðŸš€

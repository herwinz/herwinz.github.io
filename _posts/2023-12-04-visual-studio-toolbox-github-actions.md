## Overview

I recently had the opportunity to hop on the [Visual Studio Toolbox Live channel](https://www.youtube.com/@visualstudio/streams) for a 2-part DevOps series: one session on GitHub Actions and one session on [Azure Pipelines](/posts/visual-studio-toolbox-azure-pipelines/). In this video, we introduce GitHub Actions, how it varies from Azure Pipelines, and create a workflow to build and deploy a sample web app to Azure. I had a great time with Leslie and Robert, and I hope you enjoy the videos!
